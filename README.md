## Call syntax

`net2mat` can be called with 3 different syntaxes:

- `> net2mat /path/to/file.net` in this case the `.mat` file is created in the same directory and has the same filename and only the extension changes.
- `> net2mat /path/to/file.net /path/to/output/` in this case the `.mat` file is created in the output directory with the same filename: `/path/to/output/file.mat`.
- `> net2mat /path/to/file.net /path/to/output/output_file.mat` in this case the `.mat` file is created in the output path as expected.
